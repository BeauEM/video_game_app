# VIDEO GAME APP

This is a frontend (for now) react app that displays available video games to play on any platform. Uses the RAWG API to load games, platforms, genres and more.
Utilizes React Query to handle fetching and caching data and Zustand for managing state throughout the app.

## For this project I have used
